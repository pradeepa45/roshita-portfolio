          Welcome! I am a Computer Science graduate with a fervent dedication to
          mastering Business Analytics and Project Management. Proficient in
          Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I thrive on transforming raw data
          into actionable insights. Outside of my professional pursuits, you'll
          find me exploring the latest fashion trends or experimenting with new
          recipes in the kitchen.

          With a commitment to ethical integrity, I uphold the highest standards
          of data privacy and accuracy in every analysis. Collaboration is at
          the heart of my approachâ€”I thrive in team environments where diverse
          perspectives converge to tackle complex challenges. When I'm not
          delving into data, I enjoy unwinding with a good book or attending
          local art exhibitions.
        </p>
